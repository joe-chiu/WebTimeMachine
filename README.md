# WebTimeMachine
Web Time Machine is a fun project inspired by this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OB1g8CUdbA My personal goal is to learn about programming single board computer + hardware accessories over GPIO and I2C bus using .Net IoT.
The SBC is connected to a LCD display and a dial, the dial allows for changing the month and year that we should set for the Wayback Machine Proxy (https://github.com/richardg867/WaybackProxy). 
The OS should be cofigured to act as a masquerade transparent proxy for all traffic through its ethernet port, and the traffic is then routed to Wayback Machine proxy to fetch archived web pages in desired time framework.
That's it. The code is mostly about interfacing with the dial and LCD hardware, which was my learning objective.
